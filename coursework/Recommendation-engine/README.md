# Recommendations

In this repository, the three main methods are covered with an example of movie recommendation system, that are:

-   Knowledge based
-   Collaborative filtering
-   Contents based

## Rating scales

If the data collection is in control, it is imperative to consider what rating scales to collect for recommendation. A related reference can be found at the link [here](https://cxl.com/blog/survey-response-scales/).

On a 1, 0 scale or an even numbered rating scale, the user will need to be firmly on a like or dislike side of the product. With odd valued scales, a user may choose to be undecided.

## Business goals of recommendations

There are ultimately 4 goals to keep in mind when performing recommendations:

-   Relevance
-   Novelty
-   Serendipity
-   Diversity

**Novelty** concerns the user receiving recommendation of items that they have not experienced. While conducting collaborative filtering and contents based recommendations, therefore, we exclude a list of items that the user have alreadly explored.

**Serendipity** wows the user by showing items that the user has not really thought of. Content-based recommendation can achieve this by suggesting similar items based on items that the user prefer.
